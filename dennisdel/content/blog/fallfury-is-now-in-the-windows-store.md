With the [full tutorial series][1] and the [PDF eBook][2], it would only be logical that the next step in the FallFury story would be releasing the game in the Windows Store. Today, I am happy to announce that my first big game development project successfully passed certification and is now available in most of the locations worldwide in the Windows Store. 

You can download it **[here][3]**. 

It is a project that I am constantly improving, so more levels and items will be added. Feel free to review the game and [give me some feedback][4] on how the overall gameplay experience can be better.
