Vancouver has plenty of surprises in store this time of the year, as it appears! Waking up to this notification was definitely unexpected:

As it turns out, it's the [largest Christmas parade celebrated in Western Canada](https://www.foodbank.bc.ca/event/vancouver-santa-claus-parade/)! Seemed like a perfect opportunity to take out the DSLR and go capture some photos, so that's what my wife and I did. Here are the results.

## Exploration

Following the parade, we thought we would explore Vancouver a bit, so we started with the obvious - what was right around us after the parade ended. The following photos came out of that:

Oh and there is also a neat spot that can work well if you have some time, are not afraid of the cold and have a car to get there, since there is no public transit that goes way up the mountains. This is the [Cypress Mountain Viewpoint](https://binged.it/2BLUtEt).

Did I mention I am still learning how to properly use the DSLR?
