The holidays are right around the corner, and what better present is there for yourself, your loved one or your best friend than a limited edition laptop sticker that shows you support efforts to make technical documentation AWESOME?

Lucky you, our dear user, because you can now get an absolutely free laptop sticker that showcases the [.NET API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/) and the [PowerShell Module Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/).

Once you respond to the tweet with the link to the newly-created idea, I will reach out to you via DM to get your email and physical address so that I can send you the sticker. This information will not be shared with any third-parties and is purely for docs.microsoft.com feedback use.

Expect stickers to arrive via regular mail, so when you get it might vary depending on your geographical location.
