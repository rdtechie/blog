If you&#8217;ve used Instagram before, you&#8217;ve surely noticed how it handles DMs when shared from the home feed.

I was scrolling through my Twitter feed today and accidentally tapped on the DM button that resulted in this:

Looks like Twitter took a hint from Instagram on how to easily share tweets between users in private.

I&#8217;ve never used this functionality much before (or Twitter DM at all) but removing friction caused by context switches is certainly a step in the right direction and actually I can see how I am now more likely to initiate conversations based on interesting tweets I find.

This is also a win for the user, as they are already familiar with the experience flow, just in a different app. It&#8217;s certainly interesting how in the social space we see a convergence of the general user experience and offerings &#8211; recall Instagram and Messenger going after stories that originated in Snapchat as they clearly saw that the approach works.

Let&#8217;s see how this works out for Twitter.
