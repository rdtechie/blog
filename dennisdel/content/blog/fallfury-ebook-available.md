Almost a week ago, my [FallFury series][1] (building a hybrid Windows Store XAML/DirectX/C++ game) was [released on Channel9][2]. 12 articles and associated videos is a lot to go through, and you might not always have an active internet connection. 

Thatâ€™s why [Brian Peek][3] tackled the task of creating a PDF version of the series, and he did a fantastic job at it. 130 pages of content that will help you get started with creating games for Windows Store. 

[Download Here][4] 

Also, remember that you can download the FallFury source code on the [official project CodePlex page][5].
