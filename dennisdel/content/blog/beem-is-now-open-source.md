I am proud to announce today, that one of my largest Windows Phone projects – [Beem][1], is now open-source, in an effort to improve the product and to facilitate community contributions (there were many requests to add features – now devs can easily chime in).

You can find the project, as well as any additional details on <a href="https://github.com/dend/beem" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
