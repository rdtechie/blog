If you already checked out the [Intro to Azure Notification Hubs post][1], there is some new material ready for you, that describes how to build a push notification service for [Chrome][2], [Xamarin.Android][3] and [native Android][4]. Created by [yours truly][5] and [Seth Juarez][6] as part of the [Azure Friday series][7], we tried to outline the easiest way for developers to get started with the service.
