This Friday I had the pleasure of being interviewed by [Jason Young][1] and [Carl Schweitzer][2] on [MSDevShow][3], and boy did we talk about a bunch of stuff!

If you are interested on some random facts about [docs.microsoft.com][4], as well as learn how we do things, I highly recommend checking this episode out!
