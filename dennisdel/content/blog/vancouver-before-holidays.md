Living in Vancouver has a perk - the areas around Vancouver. In the past couple of weeks we got to explore several places that we had hidden in the middle of our TO-DO list, and of course we documented that through photos. This is also happens to be the season for holiday lights, so of course there ended up being quite a few of those shots in our reel.

There are two places you need to visit this season if you are in Vancouver, and that is the [Capilano Suspension Bridge](https://www.capbridge.com/) - Canyon Lights is on, and [Bright Nights at Stanley Park](http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/bright-nights-train.aspx) - another event smack in the middle of the park that I stumbled across when I was just walking our pup around.

## Bright Nights 

Located [smack in the middle of Stanley Park](https://binged.it/2l3o5qc). Bring cash (both Canadian and US Dollars work) - the entrance is "pay what you want" donation for the [BC Professional Fire Fighters' Burn Fund](http://burnfund.org/).

Worth the visit, for sure - whether you come by yourself or with the family, it's a!

## Capilano Suspension Bridge

The bridge is [located North of Lionsgate Bridge](https://binged.it/2l4Ico3) - getting there is probably the easiest by taking the [free shuttle](https://www.capbridge.com/visit/shuttle-service/).

Once there, you need to pay admission to get inside the park - prices may vary depending on the size of your group or whether you have a student ID or not. Credit cards are accepted, which is fabulous because carrying cash around is so 1999.

## Bonus - Granville St. Light Ball

Since I am on the topic of holiday lights, [there is an installation on Granville St.](https://binged.it/2l4STXu), where you should definitely go and take a picture - it's a giant ball made of light!
